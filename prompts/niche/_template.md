## [Niche] Image Guidelines

### Image Prompt Patterns

**Product Reviews:**
"[Example prompt for product imagery - use generic descriptions, not brand names]"

**Tutorials/How-To:**
"[Example prompt for instructional content imagery]"

"[Example prompt for people/activity imagery]"

### Avoiding Brand Names in Images
If your niche covers branded products, NEVER include brand names in image prompts.
AI generators cannot render brand names accurately and will create embarrassing fakes.

**Wrong:** "[Specific Brand] product on display"
**Correct:** "Premium [product type] with modern design, studio lighting"
